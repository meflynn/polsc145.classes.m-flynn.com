A few key characteristics:\n\n- Functional differentiation\n  - State consists of offices and emphasizes specializations\n  - More efficient when someone specializes in something\n  - Office is more important than a single person and persists beyond the current occupant\n- State enjoys a monopoly on the use of violence within its territory (i.e. violence is public, not private)\n- Territorial sovereignty \n\n--\n\nLots of different ways to arrange and organize\n\n- Democracies\n- Autocracies\n- Presidential systems\n- Parliamentary systems\n- Imperialist/non-imperial\n\n\n\n## Origins of the Modern State\n\nSo what determines how and why people organize?\n\nLots of things:\n\n- Biology (e.g. family relations, kin groups)\n- Basic incentives for cooperation (Protection, division of labor, etc.)\n- Technological adaptations (domestication of animals, agriculture, etc.)\n- Force and violence \n- Geography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Origins of the Modern State\n\nAgricultural Revolution:\n\n- Domestication of plants happens ~12,000 years ago\n- Different peoples and regions begin developing agricultural systems at different times\n- Hunter/gatherer and agriculture two strategies and develop alongside one another\n\n\n:::{.notes}\nNotes\n\nAgricultural Revolution \n- Begins around 10,000 BCE (~12,000 years ago)\n- We shouldn’t think that agriculture just spontaneously developed at this point in time. It’s beginnings can be traced roughly to this era, but it unfolds over thousands of years.\n  - 9000 BC in Middle East\n  - 7000 BC in East Asia\n  - 4500 BC in Central America\n  - 2000 BC in North America\n- Development of agriculture proceeds at different pace in various regions across the globe.\n  - Some settle to live off land and farm permanently\n  - Some live as hunter-gatherers and farm seasonally\n  - Some live as hunter-gatherers full time\n- We should think of these as two strategies, and historically they were typically mixtures are employed. They’re not mutually exclusive. Overall trend through time, though, is towards agriculture and farming.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n- Agriculture typically requires a long time-frame (you could starve waiting for some plants to yield food)\n- Some crops have better/worse yields. Examples of high-yield crop groups include:\n- Cereals/Grains (wheat, barley, millets, rice)\n- Pulses (peas, soybeans, peanuts, chickpea)\n- These crops also grow quickly\n- Other crops, like lettuce, take a lot of time and space to grow, and they aren’t even that nutritionally dense.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Origins of the Modern State\n\nDomestication of Animals\n\n- Begins around the same time with dogs (then sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and horses)\n- Increases food supply (and it's renewable)\n- Facilitates greater diversification and specialization of labor\n- Food surpluses mean populations can grow more quickly\n- Population can also congregate in one place\n- Larger populations require more animals means more disease (e.g. flu, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;border-bottom: 0;\">\n<caption>Percent of Large Animals Domesticated</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(81, 40, 136, 255) !important;\"> Category </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(81, 40, 136, 255) !important;\"> Eurasia </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(81, 40, 136, 255) !important;\"> Sub-Saharan Africa </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(81, 40, 136, 255) !important;\"> Americas </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 255) !important;background-color: rgba(81, 40, 136, 255) !important;\"> Australia </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Candidates </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 72 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 51 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 24 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Domesticated Species </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 13 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Percent Domesticated </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 18% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 4% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0% </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n<tfoot><tr><td style=\"padding: 0; \" colspan=\"100%\">\n<sup>1</sup> Candidates are defined as species of terrestrial, herbivorous, or omnivorous, wild mammals weighing on average over 100lbs.

Wolves with less flight instinct would benefit more from closeness to humans, as they’d be among the first to approach and get scraps. \n\n- Six Criteria for Domestication (Jared Diamond Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997)): \n  - Diet: How much food does it require? \n  - Dogs are omnivores and can survive on different foods. Lions require 17–20 lbs/day. \n  - Growth Rate: How fast? Dogs grow up quickly. Animals like elephants do not. Almost two years for a n elephant to be born!.\n  - Captive Breeding: Some animals don’t breed in captivity. For example, Cheetahs are incredibly difficult to breed in captivity. \n  - Disposition: Will they kill you? Are they aggressive? Think bears, zebra.\n  - Temperament: Do they panic? Deer and other such animals have a very low flight threshold. The can scare easily and die in captivity. \n  - Social Hierarchy: Can humans become the alpha? Are they susceptible to herd- \ning? Dogs are great at this, and we know in fact that their organizational behavior has adapted to life around humans by taking on a more hierarchical form of pack relations.\n:::\n\n\n##\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is Atlas.

Humans likely selected for submissive traits when breeding. Wolves tend to share food, while dogs with higher status in pack have greater access.

(2019) also notes that they focused more on credit for financing military operations. Land empires in Asia were less interested in maritime power projection, had large and successful land-based militaries, and were also able to finance much of their military activity directly from treasury funds. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://www.netquest.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/vhsbeta-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.notes}\n\n- We need to be careful when inferring outcomes as deterministic or pre-determined. \n\n- We often view history through the lens of European history, discussing the rise of European powers and European dominance as a clear consequence of earlier decisions or conditions.\n\n-   But sometimes the contemporaneous view is far less clear. European powers had strengths and weaknesses as did Asian powers. Some of the oft-discussed answers to European dominance don't hold up under scrutiny (e.g. Asian powers embraced firearms technology, adapted strategies and tactics, and did quite well against European forces on land and at sea.)\n\n- VHS and Beta max\n\n  - Both technologies had advantagers\n  - Beta had better resolution\n  - VHS had longer recording times\n  \n:::\n\n\n\n## The Mercantilist Era\n\nBut what **IS** Mercantilism?\n\n> Mercantilism: An economic doctrine based on a belief that military power and economic influence were complements. Applied especially to colonial empires int he 16th through 18th centuries. Monopolies at the center of mercantilist trade policies favored the mother country over its colonies and over its competitors (FLS, 5)\n\n\n\n## The Mercantilist Era\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=50%}\nExamples of mercantilist policies:\n\n- Colonialism\n\n- Monopolies\n\n- Restrictions on trade\n\n  - Tariffs\n  \n  - Quotas\n\n:::\n\n:::{.column width=50%}\n  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../media/AdamSmith.png){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n::::\n  \n:::{.notes}\n  \nNotes\n\nExamples of Mercantilist policies:\n- Colonialism: The direct territorial conquest of another part of the globe. Typically characterized by direct political and military rule by the imperial power. British government directly controlled the American colonies. Often used to extract raw materials and to provide markets for finished goods.\n- Monopolies: Government-granted exclusivity to merchants/company/corporations to operate in a particular area or trade. Government-backed firm is the sole supplier, thereby driving up prices on the goods in question. Would-be competitors are driven out of business by the state. The state benefits from the higher prices in the form of duties or taxation. Rents—the government uses its authority to extract rents from the corporation, and ultimately from consumers. \n- Restrictions on trade \n  - Import tariffs: Taxes on imported goods. \n  - Quotas: Limits on how much of a particular good can be imported for a given amount.\n- Colonies have a wide range of benefits\n  - Food: E.g., England or Japan. Limited territory. Agricultural development may be limited in some areas.\n  - Raw materials: Similar to previous point. Limited resources are available in some territories.     Geography! \n  - Slaves and forced labor: Labor is essential to increase production prior to the industrial revolution. Also, conscription during times of war. Thousands of Indian soldiers were conscripted by the British during WWI.\n  - Prestige: Think “the sun never sets on the British Empire”. Overseas colonies can also provide access (potentially exclusive) to rare goods not found in Europe. Tobacco for example. \n  - Land / Territory: See previous points on resources. Can also serve to enhance power projection capabilities. Supply depots, military bases, etc. \n  - Markets: Markets: Home state depends upon foreign markets to soak up the goods the home state produces. American colonies buying British tea. \n- Example of American colonies:\n  - Colonies could only import manufactured goods from Britain \n  - Colonies could only sell some goods, like tobacco, to Britain \n  - Taxes levied on American colonists at the end of the French and Indian War (Seven-Years’ War) were intended to help recoup costs associated with waging war on the French. \n  \n  \nThe writings of Adam Smith are a direct response to this time period.\n  \n- This also represents another misuse of history. Smith's writings are often presented as a wholesale rejection of government. Not so. Smith advocated for government and taxation to play a role in places where individual profit-seeking was insufficient to provide what people need.\n\n- He was mostly opposed to protection and tariffs. He viewed them as inefficient, and viewed the pursuit of colonies as a dangerous endeavor that put nations and their people at risk of war. \n\n- Capitalism was in many ways contrary to the established order because it sought to position the locus of economy activity somewhere other than landholding elites. \n\n:::\n  \n\n\n## The Mercantilist Era\n\nEnd of the Mercantilist Era\n\n- United States emerges as an independent nation in 1783\n\n- French Revolution begins in 1789\n\n- Napoleon rises to power, then defeated in 1815 at Waterloo\n\n- Great Britain rises to hegemonic status\n\n> Hegemony: The predominance of one nation-state over others (FLS, 8).\n\n\n\n\n# The Pax Britannica\n\n\n\n\n## The Pax Britannica\n\nWhat is the *Pax Britannica*?\n\n- Literally, the \"British Peace\"\n\n- Approximately 1815–1914, from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to the beginning of World War I\n\n- Congress of Vienna:\n\n  - Creates a post-war order in Europe\n  \n  - Emphasizes balance of power on the continent\n  \n  - France remains a continental power\n  \n  - Creates a system of consultation among European leaders\n  \n  - Partly rooted in fears of democratic revolutionaries \n  \n  \n  \n##\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](historical-background_files/figure-revealjs/interstate wars-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The Pax Britannica\n\nBritish egemony has two pillars\n\n- Naval power\n\n- Economic power\n\nBritish government also worked to maintain a balance of power among continental European powers\n\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](historical-background_files/figure-revealjs/industrial metrics-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](historical-background_files/figure-revealjs/military personnel metrics-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## The Pax Britannica\n\nGlobal Economic Relations\n\n- Technological innovations increase efficiency and productivity\n\n- Britain leads other nations in move to free trade by relaxing protectionist/mercantilist restrictions\n\n  - Allow imports from other countries\n  \n  - Increasingly search for markets to which they can export their own goods\n  \n  - Tariff reductions throughout the 1800s\n  \n\n:::{.notes}\n\nNotes\n\n- Technological innovations increase efficiency and productivity.
