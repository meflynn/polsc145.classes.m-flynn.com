What do they value?\n  \n  - Institutions: What are the prevailing rules (formal or informal) that govern actors' behavior?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nWhat's Changed/Changing?\n\n- The world is more interconnected than ever before\n\n- Demographic and political changes affect opportunities for cooperation and conflict\n\n- Political parties, ideology, age, income, etc., all affect people's interests and values\n\n- Influence of various groups is not constant\n\n\n\n## {.blank-slide}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PEW Global Attitudes Survey, 2023.](images/pew-international-engagement.jpg){width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.notes}\nNotes\n\n- Overall, a slight majority of people surveyed think countries should pay less attention to problems in other countries.\n\n- Evenly split when asked about myopically pursuing own interests vs taking other countries' interests into account\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## {.blank-slide}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PEW Global Attitudes Survey, 2023.](images/pew-ideology-active-world-affairs.jpg){width=36%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::{.notes}\nNotes\n\n- Substantial variation across countries and across ideological spectrum.\n\n- Generally, people on the left are more likely to think it's good for their country to be active in world affairs.
