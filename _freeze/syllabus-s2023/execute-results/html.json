As one of the three main subfields in political science, international relations evolved as the study of nation-states and their interactions in the global sphere. Over the past several centuries the type and frequency of these interactions, along with the range of actors involved, have increased exponentially. Given that global political and economic events are increasingly relevant for individuals\naround the world, it is imperative that we develop a solid foundation for understanding the actors, incentives, and processes that drive these events. Accordingly, this course will focus on basic facts and key concepts related to the study of international relations. We will also focus on how to analyze the casual processes underpinning events of interest.\n\n## Course Objectives\n\n1. Develop an understanding of some of the key issues in world politics.\n2. Identify some of the most important actors as they relate to these key issues.\n3. Develop an understanding of evidence-based research as it relates to these issues and actors:\n   - Develop an understanding of the relationship between observation, theory, evidence, and analysis.\n   - Identify questions, problems, or puzzles in world politics.\n   - Think about how we can develop theoretical models to help us analyze these issues.\n   - Think about how we can structure research to analyze these questions.\n   - Think about how we can collect different types of data to help us answer these questions.\n   - Think about how we can evaluate evidence to draw conclusions and generate insights.\n4. Learn to think about issues in world politics in terms of correlation, causation, and evidence.\n  \n  \n\n## Course Format \n\nThe course will be primarily lecture, thought students are encouraged to participate and ask questions where appropriate. I encourage students to ask questions if the readings of lecture materials are unclear and to reach out if they need help. In addition to class lectures students will be responsible for keeping up with readings and other class-related material as the semester progresses.\n\n\n## Required Readings \n\n@FLS2021\n\n\n\n\n## Additional Readings\n\nStudents should also make an effort to stay informed on current events. Below are a some examples of good sources for keeping up with global events. Please note that some of these publications may be pay-walled, but you should have access through the university library.\n\n  - [BBC News](www.bbc.com/news)\n  - [The Monkey Cage](www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkeycage)\n  - [Political Violence @ a Glance](www.politicalviolenceataglance.org)\n  - [Foreign Affairs](www.foreignaffairs.com)\n  - [Foreign Policy Magazine](www.foreignpolicy.com)\n  - [The Washington Post](www.washingtonpost.com)\n  - [The New York Times](www.nytimes.com)\n  - [The Economist](www.economist.com)\n  - [The Financial Times](www.ft.com)\n  \n\n## Course Requirements\n\n\n1. **Exams: 70%**:\nYour grade will largely be determined by a series of four tests. These are designed to assess your\nknowledge of basic ideas and concepts that we will cover throughout the course. All tests will be\nopen book/note, and will be administered online. They will cover material from the text book, in-class\nlectures, discussions, podcasts, and additional assigned readings. For each test you will have 75\nminutes to answer $\\approx$35 questions. There is no separate mid-term or final exams.\n\n2. **Weekly Homework: 30%**:\nYou will have routine homework assignments that are designed to provide you with exposure to the\ncourse material prior to lectures. These assignments correspond to each chapter/subject found in the\ntextbook. Students can continue to work on each assignment after they initially complete it in order to\nmaximize their grade and better familiarize themselves with the subject matter. However, grades are\nonly updated until the due date posted on Canvas. After this date students can continue working on a\ngiven InQuizitive exercise after the due date, but the grades will be locked in at their values at the time of the due\ndate.\n\n\n\n\n## Classroom Policies\n\n1. Be kind. This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I want to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment---this is a time of unparalleled stress for many of us. We're still in the middle of a global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own health and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health and safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Zoom fatigue is also a thing, so please be patient with one another. Let's try to be cognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be struggling at various points, and let's work together to make this semester as educational and enjoyable as possible. \n\n2. Be professional. While we don't have a traditional classroom environment this semester, please try to treat your interactions with everyone as professionally as you would during a normal on-campus experience. This includes not watching TV or playing video games when you are video conferencing with the instructor or your classmates. Everyone's living situation may look a little different this year, and there may be certain things that we can't control about our environments, but let's do what we can to respect one another during our shared time. \n\n3. Study guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\n\n4. Grade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit\na written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain\nan explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a\ngrade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right\nto regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on\nmy reevaluation of the assignment.\n\n5. The Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration\nof the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or\nadded as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements\nfor any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented\nin this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not\nto be reproduced without my expressed permission.\n\n6. Classroom conduct. All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by\nthe Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article\nV, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may\nbe asked to leave the class.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n## Academic Honesty and Plagiarism\n  \nAll work turned in as a part of this class must be original.\n\nKansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and parttime\nstudents enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance\nlearning.\n\nA component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all\nassignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied,\nwhether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid\non this academic work.”\n\nThe default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given\nin advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask.\n\nA grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X\nindicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Honor & Integrity System home web page](http://www.k-state.edu/honor/).\nAll work is expected to adhere to the standards outlined by the Kansas State University Handbook. All\nwritten work is subject to online plagiarism checks and will be required for all reaction papers as well as the\nfinal paper. Any cases of plagiarism will receive an automatic failure for the assignment, possible failure in\nthe course, and will be pursued further through the university for additional punishment.\n\nThe Kansas State University Handbook (2008, Appendix F) defines plagiarism as follows:\n\n> Plagiarism is taking credit for someone else’s ideas, work, or words. In a university setting, it\nmeans submitting academic, scholarly, or literary work in which you either claim or imply the\nmaterial to be your own, when that is not the case.\n\nThe Handbook also provides examples of plagiarism, and steps students can take to avoid it:\n\n[P]lagiarism could include:\n\n  - Buying a term paper, or copying another person’s paper, even if she or he gives you permission.\n  - Cutting and pasting information from the internet into your own paper without properly\nidentifying it as a quotation and properly attributing the source.\n  - Using someone else’s concept and presenting it as if it is your own original creativity, without\nacknowledging the source of the idea.\n\nWhile some acts of plagiarism are obvious attempts to deceive, like buying a term paper, others\nresult from sloppy scholarship or failure to follow proper format for crediting sources. For\nexample:\n\n  - If you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your bibliography or list of\nworks cited, yet fail to put it in quotation marks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that,\nalthough you have indicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks\nimplies that the words are your own.\n  - Paraphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the material in your own\nwords but maintained the original author’s ideas. When you paraphrase, you do not need to\nput the words in quotation marks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source.\nParaphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving out a sentence,\nwhile the rest remains the same. Even if you identify the original author, but have used faulty\nparaphrasing that retains too much of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.\n  - If you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should acknowledge doing so.\nWhile some research protocols are widespread and general enough to need no citation, if\nthe protocol, analysis, or technique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be\ncited.\n  - Works of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be misrepresented as\noriginal work by another. Such images cannot be used in part or whole without permission\nof the artist.\n\nAlso note that using papers previously written for another assignment in this, or in any other class, without\nthe express permission of the professor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material in\nthis way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can be treated as such. If you have concerns\nregarding any of these issues please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n\n## Statement Regarding Wearing of Face Coverings\n\nTo protect the health and safety of the K-State community, students, faculty, staff and visitors must wear face coverings over their mouths and noses while on K-State campuses in all hallways, public spaces, classrooms and other common areas of campus buildings, and when in offices or other work spaces or outdoor settings when 6-feet social distancing cannot be maintained. In addition, all students, faculty, and staff are required to take the COVID-19 and Face Mask Safety training. Employees who need reasonable accommodations and assistance related to required face coverings may contact the ADA coordinator at [charlott@k-state.edu](charlott@k-state.edu), and students needing accommodations may contact the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](accesscenter@k-state.edu).\n\nIn classrooms, faculty have the right to deny a student entry into the room if the student is not wearing a face covering. Students not wearing a face covering will be reminded to do so and offered a clean face covering, if one is available. If the student does not comply, the faculty member will ask the student to leave the space, and if available, join the class remotely.  As a last resort, campus police will be called. The faculty members will complete the Code of Conduct form and the Office of Student Life will look further into the issue and take the non-compliance with the request to leave into consideration of further accountability measures. \n\nAt no point should the professor or other students put themselves into an unsafe situation while attempting to enforce the face-covering policy. Manhattan campus police: 785-532-6412\n\n\n\n## Citation and Style\n\nAll written work is expected to adhere to professional standards. As described above, citing previous work is\nkey. If you have any questions regarding the appropriate citation style please consult the American Political\nScience Association style guide.\n\n\n## Students with Disabilities\n\nStudents with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about\nemergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their\ninstructor. Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to,\nphysical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety.\nIf you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses,\ncontact the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](accesscenter@k-state.edu), 785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact\nthe Academic and Career Advising Center at acac@k-state.edu, 785-826-2649.\n\nIf you have any special conditions or needs that will affect your ability to complete the required assignments\noutlined herein, please contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss your needs. I am happy to help\nyou in any way that I can. With advance notice accommodations can be made prior to deadlines and tests.\nPlease note, however, that special consideration will not be granted afterwards as a means of addressing a\ngrade you do not like.\n\n## Contacting the Instructor\n\nThe best way to get in touch with me is through email. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about course content or your abiliy to complete the assigned material.\n\n\n\n## Final Grades\n\nA: 90+\nB: 80–89.99\nC: 70–79.99\nD: 60–69.99\nF: 0–59.99\n\n\n*Tenative course schedule begins on next page*\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n## Tentative Course Schedule\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](syllabus-s2023_files/figure-html/course calendar-1.png){fig-pos='center' width=2800}\n:::\n:::\n\n  \n  \n  \n\\clearpage\n\n\n## Week 01, 01/16 - 01/20: Course Introduction\n\n### Topics:\n\n - Tuesday: Review the Syllabus.
