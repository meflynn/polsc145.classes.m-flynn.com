Over the past several centuries the type and frequency of interactions between peoples and governments have increased exponentially. These interactions range from the peaceful---trade, investment, athletics, tourism, study abroad, etc.---to the conflictual and tragic---famine, pandemics, human rights violations, and more. Furthermore, the proliferation of communications technology has allowed us to watch events unfold. in real time from almost anywhere on the globe. \n\nGiven that such events---whether social, political, or economic---are increasingly relevant for individuals around the world, it is imperative that we develop a solid foundation for understanding the actors, incentives, and processes that drive them. Accordingly, this course will focus on basic facts and key concepts related to the study of international relations. We will also focus on how to develop mental models that can help us to understand broader patterns of behavior in world affairs, and to analyze the casual processes underpinning events of interest.\n\n\n## Course Objectives\n\n1. Develop an understanding of some of the key issues in world politics.\n2. Identify some of the most important actors as they relate to these key issues.\n3. Develop an understanding of evidence-based research as it relates to these issues and actors:\n   - Develop an understanding of the relationship between observation, theory, evidence, and analysis.\n   - Identify questions, problems, or puzzles in world politics.\n   - Think about how we can develop theoretical models to help us analyze these issues.\n   - Think about how we can structure research to analyze these questions.\n   - Think about how we can collect different types of data to help us answer these questions.\n   - Think about how we can evaluate evidence to draw conclusions and generate insights.\n4. Learn to think about issues in world politics in terms of correlation, causation, and evidence.\n  \n  \n\n## Course Format \n\nThe course will be primarily lecture, thought students are encouraged to participate and ask questions where appropriate. I encourage students to ask questions if the readings of lecture materials are unclear and to reach out if they need help. In addition to class lectures students will be responsible for keeping up with readings and other class-related material as the semester progresses.\n\n\n## Required Readings \n\n- @Bates2009\n- @FLS2021\n- @Villa2019\n\n\n\n## Additional Readings\n\nStudents should also make an effort to stay informed on current events. Below are a some examples of good sources for keeping up with global events. Please note that some of these publications may be pay-walled, but you should have access through the university library.\n\n  - [BBC News](www.bbc.com/news)\n  - [Good Authority](https://goodauthority.org/)\n  - [Political Violence @ a Glance](www.politicalviolenceataglance.org)\n  - [Foreign Affairs](www.foreignaffairs.com)\n  - [Foreign Policy Magazine](www.foreignpolicy.com)\n  - [The Economist](www.economist.com)\n  - [The Financial Times](www.ft.com)\n  \n\n## Course Requirements\n\n\n1. **Exams: 50%**:\nYour grade will largely be determined by a series of four tests. These are designed to assess your knowledge of basic ideas and concepts that we will cover throughout the course. All tests will be open book/note, and will be administered online. They will cover material from the text book, in-class lectures, discussions, podcasts, and/or any additional assigned readings. For each test you will have 75 minutes to answer $\\approx$ 35 questions. There are no separate mid-term or final exams.\n\n2. **Homework and In-Class Assignments: 35%**:\nYou will have several homework and in-class assignments that are designed to provide you with deeper exposure to the course concepts. There will be approximately 6 such assignments throughout the semester. All require students to complete various exercises and submit their work to the instructor. Some of these exercises will be completed outside of class and will be turned in through Canvas. Other activities will be completed in class and will be submitted to the instructor at the end of the class session. \n\n3. **Attendance and Participation: 15%**:\nSucceeding in this class will require you to engage regularly with the course materials. The easiest way to set yourself up for success is to attend class regularly.  \n\n\n## Course Policies\n\n1. **Be kind**. Some of you may be starting with a higher baseline level of knowledge of the subjects we'll be discussing, while others may know less. Either way, everyone is here to learn! Try to approach all of your interactions in this class with a sense of kindness and curiosity. Smugness and condescension won't help you to do better in class!\n\n2. **Be professional**. Please try to treat your interactions with everyone as professionally as you would in a workplace environment.   \n\n3. **Study guides and extra credit**. The class *is* the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\n\n4. **Grade Appeals**. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit a written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain an explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a grade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right to regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on my reevaluation of the assignment.\n\n5. **Missing Assignments and Makeup Work**. I will allow students to make up work that they miss do to a University-excused absence or event. In such cases students should provide two weeks notice and documentation provided by The Office of Student Life.  Students who miss assignments due to illness may make up assignments provided they have documentation from Student Health Services.\n\n6. **The Syllabus**. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration of the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or added as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements for any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented in this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not to be reproduced without my expressed permission.\n\n7. **Contacting the Instructor**. The best way to contact me is via email. I will usually respond within two business days, but if it takes a little longer do not hesitate to send a reminder email. I do not respond to emails over the weekend. \n\n    If you wish to make an appointment you can use the Calendly link below to find an available time. Given how hectic everyone's schedules are I will assume that these meetings will be Zoom based unless otherwise requested. \n\n    Email: [meflynn@ksu.edu](meflynn@ksu.edu)\n    \n    Appointments: [Make an appointment here](https://calendly.com/meflynn)\n\n\n## Statement for Copyright Notification\n\nCopyright 2025 (Michael Flynn) as to this syllabus and all lectures.
