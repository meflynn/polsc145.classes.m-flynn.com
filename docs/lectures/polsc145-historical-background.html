# Origins of the Modern State

So what defines a nation-state? A few key characteristics:

- Functional differentiation
  - State consists of offices and emphasizes specializations
  - More efficient when someone specializes in something
  - Office is more important than a single person and persists beyond the current occupant
- State enjoys a monopoly on the use of violence within its territory (i.e. violence is public, not private)
- Territorial sovereignty

Lots of different ways to arrange and organize

- Democracies
- Autocracies
- Presidential systems
- Parliamentary systems
- Imperialist/non-imperial

# Origins of the Modern State

So what determines how and why people organize?

Lots of things:

- Biology (e.g. family relations, kin groups)
- Basic incentives for cooperation (Protection, division of labor, etc.)
- Technological adaptations (domestication of animals, agriculture, etc.)
- Force and violence 
- Geography

# Origins of the Modern State

Agricultural Revolution:

- Domestication of plants happens ~12,000 years ago
- Different peoples and regions begin developing agricultural systems at different times
- Hunter/gatherer and agriculture two strategies and develop alongside one another


???
# Notes

Agricultural Revolution 
- Begins around 10,000 BCE (~12,000 years ago)
- We shouldn’t think that agriculture just spontaneously developed at this point in time. It’s beginnings can be traced roughly to this era, but it unfolds over thousands of years.
  - 9000 BC in Middle East
  - 7000 BC in East Asia
  - 4500 BC in Central America
  - 2000 BC in North America
- Development of agriculture proceeds at different pace in various regions across the globe.
  - Some settle to live off land and farm permanently
  - Some live as hunter-gatherers and farm seasonally
  - Some live as hunter-gatherers full time
- We should think of these as two strategies, and historically they were typically mixtures are employed. They’re not mutually exclusive. Overall trend through time, though, is towards agriculture and farming.

Advantages and Disadvantages:
- Agriculture typically requires a long time-frame (you could starve waiting for some plants to yield food)
- Some crops have better/worse yields. Examples of high-yield crop groups include:
- Cereals/Grains (wheat, barley, millets, rice)
- Pulses (peas, soybeans, peanuts, chickpea)
- These crops also grow quickly
- Other crops, like lettuce, take a lot of time and space to grow, and they aren’t even that nutritionally dense.

# Origins of the Modern State

Domestication of Animals

- Begins around the same time with dogs (then sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and horses)
- Increases food supply (and it's renewable)
- Facilitates greater diversification and specialization of labor
- Food surpluses mean populations can grow more quickly
- Population can also congregate in one place
- Larger populations require more animals means more disease (e.g. flu, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, etc.)

# Notes

Subordinating other species
- Cooperation can be beneficial for agricultural development, but it can also be inter-species relationships.
- Begins very early (~12,000 years ago for big animals)
- Roots of domestication can be seen in hunter-gatherer societies
  - Dogs among first animals to be domesticated from wolves
  - Evidence indicates that some wolves would follow roving humans and feed off their scraps. Wolves with less flight instinct would benefit more from closeness to humans, as they’d be among the first to approach and get scraps. 

- Six Criteria for Domestication (Jared Diamond Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997)): 
  - Diet: How much food does it require? 
  - Dogs are omnivores and can survive on different foods. Lions require 17–20 lbs/day. 
  - Growth Rate: How fast? Dogs grow up quickly. Animals like elephants do not. Almost two years for a n elephant to be born!.
  - Captive Breeding: Some animals don’t breed in captivity. For example, Cheetahs are incredibly difficult to breed in captivity. 
  - Disposition: Will they kill you? Are they aggressive? Think bears, zebra.
  - Temperament: Do they panic? Deer and other such animals have a very low flight threshold. The can scare easily and die in captivity. 
  - Social Hierarchy: Can humans become the alpha? Are they susceptible to herd- 
ing? Dogs are great at this, and we know in fact that their organizational behavior has adapted to life around humans by taking on a more hierarchical form of pack relations.

# Notes

Domestication vs. Taming: 
- Domestication implies the animal is captured and is bred in captivity for human purposes. 
- Taming implies the animal is captured and brought under human control, but never modified in any fundamental way. 
- Many different species are tamed and some used for hunting (Monkeys, Cheetah, Bears, Eagle, etc.) 
- Actual domestication is highly skewed towards Eurasia 
- Dogs in North America are among the first animals to be domesticated 
- Genetic evidence links modern dogs to wolves 
- Recent research suggests wolves are more communal/cooperative, but dogs are more submissive. Humans likely selected for submissive traits when breeding. Wolves tend to share food, while dogs with higher status in pack have greater access.

Geography also matters

- Determines where people travel, hunt, settle, farm, etc.
- Determines the availability of flora and fauna
- Determines how plentiful supporting infrastructure can be
- Also determines the supply of diseases

# The Mercantilist Era

class: top, left

# The Mercantilist Era

Overview

- The modern nation-state system is often traced to the **Peace of Westphalia in 1648**

&gt; Peace of Westphalia: The settlement that ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648: Often said to have created the modern state system because it included a general recognition of the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention (FLS, 8).

- Focused mainly on Western Europe

- Intra-European competition preceeds this point in time, and persists long after

- Polities are scrambling to establish overseas colonies




---
class: top, left

# The Mercantilist Era

Who are the major players during this period?

- England

- France

- Spain

- Portugal

- The Netherlands (the Dutch)

- Ottoman Empire

- China

- Japan

- Mughal Empire


???
# Notes

Note that most of the European powers were focused on sea power when projecting power overseas, as well as small bands of mercenaries, and later corporations that were functional appendages of the state. 

Sharman. (2019) also notes that they focused more on credit for financing military operations. Land empires in Asia were less interested in maritime power projection, had large and successful land-based militaries, and were also able to finance much of their military activity directly from treasury funds.

- We need to be careful when inferring outcomes as deterministic or pre-determined. 

- We often view history through the lens of European history, discussing the rise of European powers and European dominance as a clear consequence of earlier decisions or conditions.

-   But sometimes the contemporaneous view is far less clear. European powers had strengths and weaknesses as did Asian powers. Some of the oft-discussed answers to European dominance don't hold up under scrutiny (e.g. Asian powers embraced firearms technology, adapted strategies and tactics, and did quite well against European forces on land and at sea.)

- VHS and Beta max

  - Both technologies had advantagers
  - Beta had better resolution
  - VHS had longer recording times

# The Mercantilist Era

But what **IS** Mercantilism?

&gt; Mercantilism: An economic doctrine based on a belief that military power and economic influence were complements. Applied especially to colonial empires int he 16th through 18th centuries. Monopolies at the center of mercantilist trade policies favored the mother country over its colonies and over its competitors (FLS, 5)

# Notes

Examples of Mercantilist policies:
- Colonialism: The direct territorial conquest of another part of the globe. Typically characterized by direct political and military rule by the imperial power. British government directly controlled the American colonies. Often used to extract raw materials and to provide markets for finished goods.
- Monopolies: Government-granted exclusivity to merchants/company/corporations to operate in a particular area or trade. Government-backed firm is the sole supplier, thereby driving up prices on the goods in question. Would-be competitors are driven out of business by the state. The state benefits from the higher prices in the form of duties or taxation. Rents—the government uses its authority to extract rents from the corporation, and ultimately from consumers. 
- Restrictions on trade 
  - Import tariffs: Taxes on imported goods. 
  - Quotas: Limits on how much of a particular good can be imported for a given amount.
- Colonies have a wide range of benefits
  - Food: E.g., England or Japan. Limited territory. Agricultural development may be limited in some areas.
  - Raw materials: Similar to previous point. Limited resources are available in some territories.     Geography! 
  - Slaves and forced labor: Labor is essential to increase production prior to the industrial revolution. Also, conscription during times of war. Thousands of Indian soldiers were conscripted by the British during WWI.
  - Prestige: Think “the sun never sets on the British Empire”. Overseas colonies can also provide access (potentially exclusive) to rare goods not found in Europe. Tobacco for example. 
  - Land / Territory: See previous points on resources. Can also serve to enhance power projection capabilities. Supply depots, military bases, etc. 
  - Markets: Markets: Home state depends upon foreign markets to soak up the goods the home state produces. American colonies buying British tea. 
- Example of American colonies:
  - Colonies could only import manufactured goods from Britain 
  - Colonies could only sell some goods, like tobacco, to Britain 
  - Taxes levied on American colonists at the end of the French and Indian War (Seven-Years’ War) were intended to help recoup costs associated with waging war on the French. 
  
  
The writings of Adam Smith are a direct response to this time period.
  
- This also represents another misuse of history. Smith's writings are often presented as a wholesale rejection of government. Not so. Smith advocated for government and taxation to play a role in places where individual profit-seeking was insufficient to provide what people need.

- He was mostly opposed to protection and tariffs. He viewed them as inefficient, and viewed the pursuit of colonies as a dangerous endeavor that put nations and their people at risk of war. 

- Capitalism was in many ways contrary to the established order because it sought to position the locus of economy activity somewhere other than landholding elites.

What is the *Pax Britannica*?

- Literally, the "British Peace"

- Approximately 1815–1914, from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to the beginning of World War I

- Congress of Vienna:

  - Creates a post-war order in Europe
  
  - Emphasizes balance of power on the continent
  
  - France remains a continental power
  
  - Creates a system of consultation among European leaders
  
  - Partly rooted in fears of democratic revolutionaries

# The Pax Britannica

Global Economic Relations

- Technological innovations increase efficiency and productivity

- Britain leads other nations in move to free trade by relaxing protectionist/mercantilist restrictions

  - Allow imports from other countries
  
  - Increasingly search for markets to which they can export their own goods
  
  - Tariff reductions throughout the 1800s
  

???

# Notes

- Technological innovations increase efficiency and productivity. Wealth is moving from the landed elites to urban manufacturers. 
  - Steam technology helps to increase trans-Atlantic transit time. 
  - First hybrid sail/steam ship crossed Atlantic in 1818. Doesn’t start to take off 
until about 1840. 
  - Transit time could be 6–10 weeks by sail. Steam cut it down to 7–14 days by early 1900s. Record is 3–4 days. 
- Ships were faster, but also became larger. Carry more people and goods.

# The Pax Britannica

Wait, what are these words you keep using?

&gt; **Protectionism**: Policies aimed at protecting domestic industries, often by blocking competing imports from other countries or using subsidies to prop up domestic industries.


&gt; **Tariff**: A tax on imported goods paid by consumers. A major tool used to advance protectionist policies.


&gt; **Subsidies**: Spending by governments to help businesses defray the costs of operating.

# The Pax Britannica

The/A Gold Standard

- Britain returned to a gold standard in 1819 to help reduce inflationary pressures following the Napoleonic Wars

- Facilitated the move to free trade

- Essentially acted as a common currency

- This becomes more "global" around the 1870s. Many states bi-metallic before this.

???

# Notes

Britain returned to gold in 1819 to help reduce inflationary pressures following Napoleonic Wars. Government wanted to maintain faith of creditors. Monetary policy partially designed to help stabilize currency and prevent inflation by tying currency to gold. 


---
class: left, top

# The Pax Britannica

Stop—what are these terms again?

&gt; **Monetary Policy**: Pertains to how a country manages the production, supply, and valuation of their currency/money. Not the same as spending and budgets (that's fiscal policy)

&gt; **Gold Standard**: A system where a country's currency (money) is backed by gold and is convertable at a certain rate.

&gt; **Free Trade**: The relaxation or elimination of protectionist policies (it's a matter of degree, not a binary condition).

&gt; **Bi-Metalism**: A monetary systen in which countries use multiple metals to back their currency (e.g. gold *and* silver)

# Notes

How can trade be more than 100% of GDP?!

It's all in how we count: 

$$   GDP = \text{Private Consumption}_{it} + \text{Investment}_{it} + \text{Government Spending}_{it} + (\text{Exports}_{it} - \text{Imports}_{it})    $$

So if total trade (i.e. imports plus exports) is very large then it can exceed overall GDP. In the following example exports are huge, but so are imports, and together they total to 175 (i.e. total trade). 

Example: $$     100 = 25 + 25 + 25 + (100 - 75)      $$

- This picture shows again how our field of vision matters.

- The BLM protests can be interpreted in a certain way if we view it primarily as a function of US politics and history. 

- We might draw very different lessons if we see similar protests errupting around the world over similar themes.
