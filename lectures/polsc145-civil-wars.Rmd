# Lecture Overview

1. Defining civil wars (revisisted)

2. Why do we see civil wars?

3. Bargaining problems

4. Strategies

# Key Questions and Goals

1. Be able to recognize some of the issues and challenges that make civil wars different from inter-state wars

2. What factors motivate individuals to rebel against their governments?

3. How do geographic and spatial factors affect mobilization, onset, and duration of civil wars?

> **Civil War**: A war in which the main participants are within the same state, such as the government and a rebel group.

You can also call these intrastate wars.

# Notes

### American Civil War
- This is what we typically think of. 
- Secessionist, policy-oriented conflict. Policy was slavery.
- Mississippi’s Articles of Secession: “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery—the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.”

- Articles for Mississippi, South Carolina, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia mention slavery ~80 times as a justification for secession. References to “rights” typically concern the rights to hold slaves. http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/secession.html

### Iraqi–Kurd Wars: 
- Kurds live in semi-autonomous region in Northern Iraq. 
- Oil-rich region. 
- Conflicts began in the 1960s and have flared up repeatedly since. Kurds want more autonomy and more resources from central government. 
- Saddam gassed thousands of Kurds in the late 1980s. Arab resettling program designed to move Arabs from southern and central Iraq into Northern Kurdistan to dilute Kurdish power in the region. During the 1990s Saddam established a smuggling operation that moved oil through Kurdistan.

# Group Factors:

- Social networks: Ethnic, family, and religious ties can help to mobilize individuals. Social networks make it easier to identify individuals with similar grievances, or to identify individuals who are not contributing. Shared ethnic or religious identity may also make it harder to avoid being drawn into conflicts, as these groups are often concentrated in one geographical area and governments may use force indiscriminately against these populations, meaning that you can’t just “sit this one out”. 

- Some may contribute because they are “true believes”. Shared ideology might help to overcome the collective action problem if you have a strong preference for a particular policy or outcome. Often the case with religious groups, or Marxist groups. 

- Groups often pay fighters to support their cause. Payments often come from spoils of war, natural resources (oil, diamonds, etc.), or from human and/or sex trafficking.

# Organization and Mobilization

State-level factors

- Wealth and development

  - Mechanisms for resolving grievances

- Geography

# Afghan Poppy Trade

- Counternarcotics operations often hurt the poorest and most marginalized groups, and also increase opposition to US-led counterinsurgency operations.

- Overall poppy production is worth over $30 billion to Afghan economy (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/11/21/afghanistans-opium-production-is-through-the-roof-why-washington-shouldnt-overreact/)/

# Bargaining Problems

## Bargaining in Civil Wars

Basic problems resemble those in interstate wars

Sources of bargaining failure

- Private/incomplete information

- Commitment problems

- Issue indivisibility

Civil wars have features that can exacerbate these issues




---
# Bargaining Problems

Civil Wars often characterized by power asymmetries

Incentivizes insurgencies over traditional maneuver battle

- Small units

- Often blend in with civilian population

- Lightly armed

- Harassment

- Hit and run attacks

- Terrorism
