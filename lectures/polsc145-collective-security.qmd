## Lecture Overview

1. What is collective security?

2. Historical development

3. Current status

4. Military interventions





## Key Questions and Goals

1. What is collective security?

2. How does it differ from collective defense and alliances?

3. Who contributes and why?

4. When and where are interventions effective?

5. What are the consequences of peacekeeping?






# Defining Collective Security






## Defining Collective Security

What are collective security institutions?

> Broad-based institutions that promote peace and security among their members (FLS)

Key points

- Broad-based

- Institutions

- **Among** member states




## Defining Collective Security


What are they designed to do?

- Promote peaceful resolution of disputes between member states

- Provide a structure and forum for routine communication and negotiation between states

- Deter and/or punish acts of aggression

# Current Status




## Current Status

 Purpose has changed over time

- Emphasis on interstate conflict remains, but...

- Conceptualization of security has broadened

  - Conflict within states
  
  - Human rights issues
  
  - Environmental and health issues
  
  
  
  

## Current Status

 UN activities include

- Peacekeeping missions
- International police missions
- Monitoring chemical and nuclear weapons
- Conflict mediation
- Humanitarian interventions
- Monitoring election integrity
- Monitoring and responding to global health crises





## Current Status

 UN Organization

- Security Council
  - Five permanent members (US, UK, France, Russia, China)
  - 10 temporary members
  - Decisions require unanimous consent of permanent members and majority of temporary members
- General Assembly
  - Consists of all UN member states
  - Representatives routinely meet to discuss global issues
- Subsidiary agencies
  - Specialize in monitoring particular issues
  - Collect and disseminate information from/to member countries
  - Conduct inspections, aid in enforcement
  - Examples include World Health Organization, International Atomic Energy Agency, etc.
  
  



## Current Status

 Types of Interventions

- Peace Enforcement

- Peacekeeping

- Humanitarian






#Interventions





## Interventions

 Why does the UN intervene?

- Conflicts between states

- Conflicts within states

- Conditioning factors

  - Do major powers have strong interests?
  - Do regional powers have strong interests?
  - How big and/or complex is the conflict?

## Current Status

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
 Is peacekeeping effective?

It depends

- Peace enforcement is less effective

- Peacekeeping has a higher success rate

- Selection effects?

- Negative externalities
