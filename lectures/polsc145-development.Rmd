# What is Development and Why Do We Care?

**Economic development**: Think about features of a country's economy

- Level of economic productivity

- Growth of the economy and productivity

- *What* a country produces

- Investment in infrastructure

- Acquisition of capital (both human and otherwise)

- Poverty



---
# What is Development and Why Do We Care?


**Human development**: Economic data don't always capture the full picture of what life is like in a country

- Overall quality of life

- Lifespan 

- Infant mortality rates

- Education

- Access to healthcare and health outcomes

- Crime rates



---

# What is Development and Why Do We Care?


There are lots of indicators we could look at, but here are some key indicators that are commonly used to evaluate a country's development:

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

- GDP Per Capita (GDP / Population)

- Economic Growth

- Poverty

- Infant Mortality Rates

# What is Development and Why Do We Care?

Economic Growth

- This is an important indicator

- It tells us how much GDP has grown (typically from one year to the next)

- But it has limitations, and context is necessary

--

Let's look at how we calculate growth rates:

$$\text{Growth Rate}_{t} = {{GDP_t - GDP_{t-1}} \over GDP_{t-1}}$$




---
# What is Development?

What does this mean in practice?

- Growth isn't always the best indicator of success

- Larger, more developed, and more diverse economies may have lower overall growth rates

- Let's look at why

--

  - $1,000 GDPPC increasing by $1,000 is a 100% increase in GDPPC
  
  - $10,000 GDPPC increasing by $1,000 is a 10% increase in GDPPC
  
  
  
---
# What is Development?

Poverty

- GDP and GDP Per Capita tell us about aggregate wealth

- They don't provide us with information on income distributions

- Distrubtion of wealth is usually skewed

- Conflict 

- Institutions

# How Do States Develop?

Resource curse

- States with access to large stockpiles of natural resources often have low levels of development

- Oil, diamonds, gold, silver, etc.

- Access to lucrative natural resources often associated with corruption

- Export Oriented Industrialization (EOI)

Import Substituting Industrialization (ISI)

- Emphasizes development of domestic industry and the enhancement of economic self-sufficiency

- Uses protectionist measure to raise costs of imported goods (high tariffs, quotas, etc.)

- Popular in Latin America

- Has some serious shortcomings

Positives
- Can help to develop domestic industries.

Downsides
