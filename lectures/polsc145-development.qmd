## Lecture Overview

1. What is development and why do we care?

2. How do states develop?

3. Controversy in development


## Key Questions

1. What are some of the key indicators of countriesâ€™ economic development? 

2. What are some of the strengths and weaknesses of different developmental indicators?

3. How do previous topics like conflict, trade, finance, and monetary policy affect development?

# What is Development and Why Do We Care?



## What is Development?

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
Development is complicated

Two broad categories

- Economic

- Human
:::

:::{.column width=50%}

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}

```
:::

## What is Development?

**Economic development**: Think about features of a country's economy

- Level of economic productivity

- Growth of the economy and productivity

- *What* a country produces

- Investment in infrastructure

- Acquisition of capital (both human and otherwise)

- Poverty






## What is Development?

**Human development**: Economic data don't always capture the full picture of what life is like in a country

- Overall quality of life

- Lifespan 

- Infant mortality rates

- Education

- Access to healthcare and health outcomes

- Crime rates





## What is Development?

There are lots of indicators we could look at, but here are some key indicators that are commonly used to evaluate a country's development:

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

- GDP Per Capita (GDP / Population)

- Economic Growth

- Poverty

- Infant Mortality Rates

## What is Development?

Economic Growth

- This is an important indicator

- It tells us how much GDP has grown (typically from one year to the next)

- But it has limitations, and context is necessary

:::{.incremental}

Let's look at how we calculate growth rates:

$$\text{Growth Rate}_{t} = {{GDP_t - GDP_{t-1}} \over GDP_{t-1}}$$
:::



## What is Development?

What does this mean in practice?

- Growth isn't always the best indicator of success

- Larger, more developed, and more diverse economies may have lower overall growth rates

- Let's look at why


  - $1,000 GDPPC increasing by $1,000 is a 100% increase in GDPPC
  
  - $10,000 GDPPC increasing by $1,000 is a 10% increase in GDPPC
  
  
  
  
  
## What is Development?

Poverty

- GDP and GDP Per Capita tell us about aggregate wealth

- They don't provide us with information on income distributions

- Distrubtion of wealth is usually skewed

:::{.notes}

Thinking back on what we just covered, how is it that so many of these countries have grown more than the United States since 1960?

Less developed countries have a lower starting point, and so any amount added will represent a larger share of their GDP as compared to larger economies.

The US is an example of how countries tend to move away from primary products as they become wealthier.

Money lets them invest in more capital intensive activities while they shift to importing less profitable products.

Geographic and environmental factors

- Geography can influence things like resource endowments (natural resources, animals, etc.)

- Geography can also provide opportunities

## How Do States Develop?

Resource curse

- States with access to large stockpiles of natural resources often have low levels of development

- Oil, diamonds, gold, silver, etc.

- Access to lucrative natural resources often associated with corruption




## How Do States Develop?

Domestic factors

- Infrastructure

- Conflict 

- Institutions

Things that we've talked about before. 

Democracies tend to be more stable, and tend to have more transparency in policymaking.

The rule of law and respect for human rights is also a big thing.

Import Substituting Industrialization (ISI)

- Emphasizes development of domestic industry and the enhancement of economic self-sufficiency

- Uses protectionist measure to raise costs of imported goods (high tariffs, quotas, etc.)

- Popular in Latin America

- Has some serious shortcomings

Positives
- Can help to develop domestic industries.
- Can reduce dependency on foreign imports

Downsides
- Can be an inefficient allocation of resources
- Increases prices of goods

Export oriented industrialization (EOI) 

- Emphasizes the use of abundant (cheap) labor and low production costs

- Builds on comparative advantage framework

- Attractive for foreign investors looking to lower costs of production

- Popular among several Asian countries (South Korea, Singapore, China)

## How Do States Develop?

International factors

- Number and proximity of regional trading partners

- Position in the international economy

- Access to international finance

- Monetary policy

- Are international economic institutions biased?

## How Do States Develop?

Where does development aid go?

- Disease treatment and prevention

- Healthcare

- Clean water

- Education

- Agricultural research

- Food aid

- Support for women and children


:::{.notes}

Donors often partner with local groups to provide resources and expertise. 

Funding goes to both domestic actors and business, but also local businesses and actors. 

Disease treatment, healthcare, etc., examples: 

- Malaria isn't readily treatable. Aid often goes to mosquito repellants, bed nets, improved irrigation (to stop mosquitos from breeding, etc.).

- Presidents Emergency Program for Aids Relief (PEPFAR). Established in 2003 it provided educational resources and treatments for millions of people with HIV and AIDS. Estimated to have saved over 25 million people. Invested over $100 billion across 20 yearsâ€”that's about \$5 billion per year. For reference, US spends 800+ billion on DOD every year. 

- Tuberculosis treatment: TB is incredibly infectious and VERY difficult to treat. Antibiotic courses last for 6-9 months. Incomplet treatments can make it more difficult or impossible to sucessfully treat and can lead to far more deadly strains of TB evolving. [University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Prevention](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/tuberculosis/usaid-funding-freeze-disrupts-global-tuberculosis-control-efforts) indicates over 55 million lives have been saved since 2000 through USAID TB treatment programs. 

- Also provide expertise for treating outbreaks of Ebola, which is super deadly.

- Provide treatment for malnourished people. Limited access to foods deprives people of needed nutrients.

- May provide treatment for women who have been victims of sexual assault or gender-based violence. Often supports groups who provide shelter and protection against further attacks. 

Agricultural research and support

- Research at US and other universities looks at how crops can be made more resilient to climate change, pests, blight, etc. 

- Might also look to improve irrigation technologies for more efficient water use.


- Food and Water:

- Food production in US is also used to feed people abroad. Helps to support farm prices and addresses world hunger

- Aid groups will build wells and provide water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water. This eliminates disease and parasites.

:::{.notes}

Guinea Worm Disease:

- Millions of people lack clean and safe drinking water

- Guinea Worm larvae live on tiny crustaceans called "water fleas"

- People consume water containing these tiny crustaceans.

- Symptoms don't usually develop until one year after the larvae are ingested. The worm grows inside of the person during that time, reaching lengths of up to 3 feet! Then it burrows its way out of the human or animal, usually throught he legs of feet. 

- This proecess causes intense pain, fever, swelling, and large blisters. 

- Secondary infections are also possible if the wounds where the worm exists become infected. 

- See [CDC webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/guinea-worm/about/index.html) for more info on Guinea Worm Disease.
