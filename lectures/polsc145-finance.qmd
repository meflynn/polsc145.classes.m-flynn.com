## Lecture Overview

1. What is international finance?

2. Why do people invest abroad?

3. Controversy and conflict in international finance



## Key Questions and Goals

1. How does the Heckscher–Ohlin Theory help us to understand capital flows?

2. What sorts of political factors affect lending and borrowing decisions?

3. How do international financial flows relate to trade? To monetary policy?





# What is international finance?



## What is international finance?

Factors of production

- Land

- Unskilled labor

- Skilled labor (human capital)

- Capital



## What is international finance?

Finance

- Investment and the allocation of capital

- About the flow of money across borders

Monetary policy

- Concerns the valuation, supply, and manipulation of currency



## What is international finance?

Three main types of financial relations:

- Portfolio investment

- Sovereign lending

- Foreign direct investment (FDI)



## What is international finance?

Portfolio investment

- Buying stock (equity) in a foreign company

- Lending money to a foreign company or government (buying bonds)

- No control over investment (usually)




## What is international finance?

Sovereign lending

- Loans from private financial institutions to foreign governments (buying bonds)

- This is the biggest category of portfolio investment (a subset of portfolio investment)

- Debt




## What is international finance?

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

- Investment by a company in one country into a foreign country

- Buying or investing in a subsidiary, opening a factory or branch

- Control over investment




## What is international finance?

Who are the relevant actors?

- States

- Individuals

- Firms

Defining debt relationships:

- Creditors: People who loan money

- Debtors: People who borrow money

# Why Invest Overseas?





## Why Invest Overseas?

Profit: To make (more) money

Heckscher–Ohlin theory

- Countries will export goods that make intensive use of the factors that are abundant

- Countries will import goods that make intensive use of the factors that are scarce




## Why Invest Overseas?

Holders of capital make money by investing it with the expectation of generating a return

Returns can take the form of:

- Access to cheap labor or foreign markets may also increase returns to investment

- Dividends, interest, appreciation, etc.




## Why Invest Overseas?

Applying the Heckscher-Ohlin framework

Example #1: Abundant capital

- One borrower

- Multiple lenders

## Why Invest Overseas?

Demand within target state

Two general types:

- **Private**: Private interests in developing countries need capital to build, expand, and develop industry

- **Public**: Governments need to borrow money to finance public works projects, military capabilities, war, etc.






# Conflict and Controversy






## Conflict and Controversy

Less Developed Countries (LDCs)

Borrow money to promote growth

- Infrastructure (roads, electric lines, etc.)

- Promote domestic startups

- Promote innovation

Increasing the size of the economy should increase government revenues.

Notes

- Basic idea is that your tax rate doesn't have to change to increase government revenues.

- But this means you have to grow the economy.

## Conflict and Controversy

Heckscher-Ohlin framework doesn't explain all investment patterns

- Majority of international investment flows from developed countries to other developed countries

- Why?

:::{.incremental}

Well, there are a few reasons...

- Investment, development, and growth strategies don't always work out (even if they're sensible)

- Governments sometimes expropriate investments and property

- Instability and conflict can disrupt production

- Higher interest rates are also due to risk (i.e. creditors charge more because of risks)

:::{.notes}

Notes

- Helps to show broader investment patterns and relative valuation over time, rather than just outflows from US. 

- Also helps to look at a wider range of investment flows. FDI is more intensive investment. These funds are not focusing on such major investments. 

- Price increases/decreases can tell us something about investors’ expectations.

- Emerging markets have the potential to be very profitable, but also expose investors to significant volatility and risk.

Example: Venezuela

- Hugo Chavez nationalized 1,162 companies between 2002 and 2012

- This means that the Venezuelan government took control of private property, many controlled by international firms

:::{.notes}

Notes

- 1,162 companies nationalized by Venezuelan government between 2002 and 2012. 

- Owens–Illinois plant expropriated in 2010.

- Operated plant in Venezuela for 52 years. 

- Chavez accused the company of environmental damage and exploiting workers.  

- Venezuelan law requires that the legislature declares the expropriation is “in the public interest”, and the subject of the expropriation is allowed to present a defense against expropriation and they are also entitled to receive compensation. But this does not happen.

- Executive decree ignores Chavez’ rationale and instead says the company was unfairly exploiting its dominant market position. 

- Company given no advanced notice of expropriation and staff were kicked out a few days after the announcement. 

- International tribunal awarded Owens–Illinois $455 million, but it’s unclear when, or how much, they will be paid.

- As of 2017 they have still not recovered their investment costs. A GM plant was also expropriated by the Venezuelan government in 2017. 

- See Wall Street Journal article, Economist article, and Toledo Blade article.

## Conflict and Controversy

Debt and conflict

-  Regardless of the issue, debts don't go away just because the borrower's situation has changed

- Think student loans, but less forgiving

Terms to know:

> **Default**: Occurs when borrowers fail to make payments on their debts

> **Austerity**: Policies aimed at reducing consumption (spending) and assuring creditors. Often includes tax increases/decreases, raising interest rates, reduced government spending, and wage restrictions.





## Conflict and Controversy

The puzzle:

- Default and austerity hurt both borrowers and lenders

-  Why can't debtors and creditors restructure the terms of the loan? (e.g. repayment time, number of installments, interest rates, etc.)

After all, both sides have incentives to maintain good relations

- Creditors **need** borrowers to make profits

- Less-developed countries need access to foreign capital markets to finance growth, economic development, etc.





## Conflict and Controversy

Bargaining Problems

- Bargaining models can be useful in thinking about creditor-debtor relationships, too

- Debtors have incentives to misrepresent ability to pay to get better terms

- Creditors also have incentives to misrepresent what they can accept to get a better deal.  They can also retaliate by threatening to cut off access to funding.

- Credibility of each can be hard to establish (i.e. private information)
