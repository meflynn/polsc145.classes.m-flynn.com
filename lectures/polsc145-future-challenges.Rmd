# Background Review

Four primary "pillars" of the international order

1. Sovereignty

2. Collective Security

3. Bretton Woods System

4. Promotion of Human Rights and Democracy

--

These things are based on and implemented using

- Liberal values

- Multilateral cooperation

- US Hegemony

# Background Review

Key Institutions

- United Nations

- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (World Trade Organization)

- International Monetary Fund

- World Bank

- North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

What are the issues?

- (Bad) Non-state actors

- Nuclear proliferation

- Biological weapons

- Cyberattacks

- Revisionist powers (e.g. China, Russia, etc.)

- Global health and pandemics

- Climate change and environmental degradation 

- Populist movements 

- Political and economic instability

# Moving Forward

So what's to be done?

- Lots of different issues, but there are also lots of common themes and characteristics

- The work is increasingly interconnected, and so externalities from human behavior (both positive and negative) are increasingly visible

- People have shared interests in solving these problems

- Most human interaction is, in fact, benign/cooperative

  
  
---
class: left, top

# Moving Forward

So what are some of these common themes/frameworks?

  - Collective action 
  
  - Cooperation and coordination (think about rules and incentive structures)

  - Bargaining (think about people's interests and what's possible)
  
--

Factors that shape or affect the specifics of these frameworks

  - Actors: Who are the relevant players?
  
  - Interests: What do the players want? What do they value?
  
  - Institutions: What are the prevailing rules (formal or informal) that govern actors' behavior?

# Moving Forward

Other tips:

- Most of the things we care about are caused by lots of other different things (complex systems)...

- ...But not everything has the same amount of causal influence/importance

- Most of the causal relationships that we care about are probabilisticâ€”not deterministic (i.e. more or less likely)
