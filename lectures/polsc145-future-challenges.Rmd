# Moving Forward

So what's to be done?

- Lots of different issues, but there are also lots of common themes and characteristics

- The work is increasingly interconnected, and so externalities from human behavior (both positive and negative) are increasingly visible

- People have shared interests in solving these problems

- Most human interaction is, in fact, benign/cooperative

  
  
---
class: left, top

# Moving Forward

So what are some of these common themes/frameworks?

  - Collective action 
  
  - Cooperation and coordination (think about rules and incentive structures)

  - Bargaining (think about people's interests and what's possible)
  
--

Factors that shape or affect the specifics of these frameworks

  - Actors: Who are the relevant players?
  
  - Interests: What do the players want? What do they value?
  
  - Institutions: What are the prevailing rules (formal or informal) that govern actors' behavior?



---
# Moving Forward

What's Changed/Changing?

- The world is more interconnected than ever before

- Demographic and political changes affect opportunities for cooperation and conflict

- Political parties, ideology, age, income, etc., all affect people's interests and values

- Influence of various groups is not constant

# Notes

- Overall, a slight majority of people surveyed think countries should pay less attention to problems in other countries.

- Evenly split when asked about myopically pursuing own interests vs taking other countries' interests into account

```


???

# Notes

- Substantial variation across countries and across ideological spectrum.

- Generally, people on the left are more likely to think it's good for their country to be active in world affairs. People on the right are more skeptical.

```

# Notes

- Similarly, people on the left are more likely to say that you should take other people's/countries' interests into account.

- We also see significant variation across countries.

```

???
# Notes

- Next let's consider more general attitudes about how close people feel to people in outher countries.

- Again, significant variation around the world, but people in Europe, Kenya, India, Japan, and Korea generally express higher levels of closeness to people in other countries than people in the US and Latin America.

# Notes

- Again we see significant variation across countries and across ideological self-identification.

```

# Notes
- If we look at the United States we can observe similar patterns.

# Notes

- We've seen that people in other countries are often divided in their views of world affairs
- But what the U.S. and other powerful countries do matters a lot
- In spite of partisan/ideological differences in other countries, people generally have a positive view of Biden's foreign policy agenda.
- We see variation across countries, but generally people are more positive than negative.
- The values are generally high.

```

???

# Notes

- This shows a more direct comparison between 2019 (Trump Presidency) and 2021 (Biden Presidency) views of US foreign policy decisions
- President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreements. 
- Biden later announced the U.s. would rejoin the agreement. 
- In general, people around the world like it when the US engages more.

```

???
# Notes

- With respect to domestic approval of Biden's climate change policies, younger people are generally more bullish on more aggressive measures to mitigate climate change.

- Even among self-identified Republicans, younger people are more likely to support aggressive measures to mitigate climate change.

- Older groups are generally less supportive, even among Democrats.

- It's tempting to frame everything in terms of partisanship, but partisanship doesn't explain everything. 



---
class: left, top

# Moving Forward

Why does this matter?

--

- Do you pursue policies just because they're popular abroad?

--

- What are the implications of these attitudes for international cooperation?

--

- How do international actors affect the ability of the US to pursue *its own* interests?

- Issue linkage
  - Trade
  - Investment
  - Military basing
  - Climate change
  - Pandemic response
  - Counter-terror operations
  - Anti-piracy operations
  - Peace and stability operations

# Moving Forward

Other tips:

- Most of the things we care about are caused by lots of other different things (complex systems)...

- ...But not everything has the same amount of causal influence/importance

- Most of the causal relationships that we care about are probabilistic—not deterministic (i.e. more or less likely)

- Be cautious when comparing what seem like apples to other apples
