Opening notes

1. Sorry this isn't how we all wanted to meet up!
2. Make sure everyone is in the correct class
3. Talk a little bit about the motivations for the course.
    - Close to Fort Riley
    - Lots of students may have family members in the military
    - Have you traveled or studied abroad?
    - Have family or friends from other countries?
    - Human rights issues
    - Trade (Kansas has a long history of agricultural production and exports)

We'll talk more about this stuff later, and throughout the course, but it's important to think about the reasons you might care.

We can talk about the details of the course later, but first let's have some fun to motivate the course!
