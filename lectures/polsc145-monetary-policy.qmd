## Lecture Overview

1. Why money?

2. What is monetary policy?

3. Why and how monetary policy matters?



## Key Questions

1. What is the role of central banks in the economy?

2. How do interest rates arrect the economy, and inflation/unemployment, specifically?

3. How do exchange rates affect producers and consumers?





# Why Money?



## Why Money

- Barter system can be inefficient

- International trade and investment require convertibility

- More currencies make trade and investment difficult

- Standardization of currencies associated with growth of trade and investment




## Why Money

Example: Pre-Constitution United States  

- States able to print their own currencies

- Relative valuations differed wildly

- Impeded trade among states





# What is Monetary Policy?




## What is Monetary Policy?


> **Monetary Policy**: Changes in a country’s money supply undertaken in an attempt to manage aggregate economic activity (Oatley 2010, 387).  

> **Central Bank**: The institution that regulates monetary conditions in an economy, typically by affecting interest rates and the quantity of money in circulation.

- Central Bank of the United States. 
- Federal reserve act of 1913 created the current Federal Reserve System. 
- Preceded by the First and Second Banks of the United States. 
- This was a political battle that was fought repeatedly since the founding. Alexander Hamilton was a big proponent of establishing a central bank.
- Led by the Chair of the Board of Governors. Serves a 4-year term. Board members are appointed to 14-year terms. 
- Manages US monetary policy. Essentially the fed is like the bank for banks.

## What is Monetary Policy

Basic terms

> **Exchange rates**: Determines the value of one currency relative to other currencies. The price of one currency relative to another.

> **Appreciate (alt Strengthen, revalue)** When a currency becomes more valuable relative to another currency or benchmark.

> **Depreciate: (alt Weaken, devalue)** When a currency becomes less valuable relative to another currency or benchmark.



## What is Monetary Policy

Exchange rate regimes

- Fixed

- Mixed systems

- Free float


:::{.notes}
Notes

- Fixed Regimes: The gold standard: All countries fixed their currencies to a set amount of gold. Because all currencies were convertible to gold, exchange of currencies was relatively easy. 

- Mixed regimes: The Bretton Woods System: 	The Bretton Woods System saw the dollar fixed to a certain amount of gold ($35/ounce). Other countries pegged their currencies to the dollar and were allowed periodic adjustments to the exchange rate. US abandoned convertibility to gold in 1973 under President Nixon. 

Floating regimes: The current system: Closest to the current system. Major economies/countries have freely floating exchange rates relative to one another. Smaller economies will often peg their currencies to one of the major currencies, or outright adopt one of those currencies.

:::{.notes}
Fixed exchange rates provide stability in currency convertibility, making trade and investment easier. However, promising to fix exchange rates and keeping them constant means that you cannot manipulate monetary policy as freely to address domestic economic conditions. Specifically, the government cannot alter interest rates to affect the economy.

Notes

- Draw the continuum drawing here. Note that governments actually intervene a lot and have a very activist role when they are defending the relative valuation of a currency. 

- Prices respond to supply and demand. 

- Fixed Regimes: Governments have to purchase and sell currencies to maintain the fixed exchange rate. This can lead to a loss of autonomy over domestic fiscal policy. Lots of government intervention.
  - If more people want to buy dollars then the value of the dollar increases (it appreciates). If fewer people want dollars then the price decreases (it depreciates).
  - Governments use foreign exchange reserves to buy and sell currencies to maintain the value of their currency.
  - If the dollar is weaker than it should be the government will buy more dollars (reducing the supply in circulation and increasing value).
  - If the dollar is stronger than it should be the government will sell more dollars (increasing the supply in circulation and decreasing value).

- Floating Regimes: Governments have more control over domestic fiscal policy, but exchange rates can be more volatile.
  - If more people want to buy dollars then the value of the dollar increases (it appreciates). If fewer people want dollars then the price decreases (it depreciates). But it's market forces at work here, not governments.
  
- Current system is somewhere in the middle—a managed float system. Governments do not necessarily try to maintain a specific value, but intervene to manipulate currency values to advance particular goals.

- Bretton Woods System had a fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate system. This meant governments were expected to maintain the value of their currency against some asset (gold or the dollar) but could adjust the value of their currency if necessary.

# Why Monetary Policy Matters



## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Lots of reasons

- If affects the value of your money

- It affects the ease with which you can use your money to buy things

- This, in turn, affects what you can buy and how much it costs

- It can also affect other things, like investment and trade relationships

## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Implications for trade

- We need to exchange our currency for the currencies of the countries we trade with

- For example, buying Chinese exports necessitates that companies (at some point) turn US dollars into Chinese Yuan

## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Implications for trade

- Valuation affects different segments of society in different ways

- Exporters generally benefit from a weaker currency

- Domestic consumers benefit from a stronger currency



## Why Monetary Policy Matters

The case of China

- Chinese government made a decision to devalue its currency

- Devaluation begins in the 1980s through 1990s

- Weaker Yuan relative to US dollar promotes Chinese exports

- US policymakers have protested the artificial weakness of Chinese currency in recent years

- Prices are lower for US consumers of Chinese goods, but at the expense of US jobs

## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Example: Shoes made in China and sold in US

- Assume an exchange rate: ¥7 = $1

- 1 pair of shoes costs ¥700 to produce

- 1 pair of shoes costs $100 in the US

- ¥7 x $100 = ¥700



## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Example: Shoes made in China and sold in US

- Assume Yuan appreciates to ¥5 (~29%) = $1

- 1 pair of shoes still costs ¥700 to produce 

- 1 pair of shoes now costs $140 in the US 

- ¥5 x $140 = ¥700

## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Types of monetary policies

- Expansionary

  - Intended to stimulate economic activity
  - Lower interest rates, increasing money supply, increasing prices

- Restrictive

  - Intended to slow (“cool”) economy down
  - Increasing interest rates, decreasing money supply, decreasing prices
  
  
  
## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Interest rates

- Federal Funds Rate

- The rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans




## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Effects of interest rates

- Lowering the target rate… 
  - Makes it cheaper to borrow
  - Facilitates access to domestic capital and stimulates demand

- Increasing the target rate… 
  - Makes it more expensive to borrow
  - Attracts foreign capital (more profitable to invest in country with high rates). 
  


## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Effects of lowering interest rates

- Lower rates makes money cheaper and more abundant

- Businesses and people will consume more

- Increased demand and consumption will drive prices up and unemployment down

## Why Monetary Policy Matters

Fixed exchange regimes: Gold standard

- Gold standard fixes currency value to gold

- Also limits the money supply (supply is tied to amount of gold)

- Keeps exchange rates stable

- But…State can’t use monetary policy to fix domestic economic problems because government must use interest rates to maintain exchange rate

Notes

- Widely viewed as an allegory depicting the folly of the gold standard 

- Oz is abbreviation for ounce 

- Wicked witches of the east and west (bankers and financiers on east and west coasts) 

- Yellow brick road leads to emerald city (gold road leads to money and prosperity) 

- Dorothy is a young and naive girl from Kansas (naive farmers) 

- Scarecrow represents farmers (no brains because they borrowed from unscrupulous lenders in the Northeast) 

- Tin Man represents the Northeastern industrial workers (Had no heart to side with farmers against Northeastern upper classes) 

- Dorothy’s slippers were originally silver in the book (replaced with ruby slippers to take advantage of technicolor). Silver is the solution to Dorothy’s problem (wanting to go home).
