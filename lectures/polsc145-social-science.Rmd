# Key Questions and Goals

1. Develop a better understanding of what even is Science?
2. Think about why we need theories in the social sciences?
3. Identify strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches
4. Be able to think about causal relationships and outcomes in probabilistic terms
5. Develop a better understanding of the different stages of the research process
6. Think about the important of measurement in social sciences

# Motivations

What do we mean when we talk about social science?

- Science is not just a noun (i.e. a thing)

- It's a verb

- Science is a method of structuring inquiryâ€”it's the *way* we go about structuring our approach to research

- Emphasis on transparency, replicability, rigor, etc.



---
class: left, top

# Motivations

Our goals can vary depending on the question or problem

- Descriptive
- Causal
- Predictive

More broadly

- Produce generalizeable knowledge
- Solve interesting problems
- Determine effects of policies, interventions, etc.
- Improve the human condition
- Alleviate human suffering
- And more

class: left, top

# Motivations

Description

- We want to know what a thing actually looks like

- We want to know what the relationship between two things looks like

- Necessitates accurate measurement

- Examples:

  - How long do most wars last?
  - Are most countries in the world democracies, autocracies, or something else?
  - Are democracies wealthier than non-democracies?
  - Do wealthy countries have better human rights records?

# Motivations

Causation

- Does the manipulation of some variable necessarily lead to, or increase the probability of, an outcome of interest?

- The occurrence of one event/phenomena is the consequence of another

- Correlation does not equal causation (except when it does)

- Alternatively, causation does not necessarily equal (observable) correlation

- Examples:

  - Does a country's level of democracy affect the frequency with which it goes to war?
  - Will expanding public transportation reduce poverty in a city?


???
# Notes

A good example here is pressing a gas pedal in a car. On a flat surface pressing the pedal clearly causes an observable increase in speed. But on an increasingly steep hill pressing down on the gas pedal will help you maintain a constant speed as the incline increases (assuming lots of other factors hold constant).

# Motivations

Predictive Analysis

- We want to understand variation in outcomes

- This often requires considering relationships between outcomes and multiple predictors

- Individual causal relationships don't always explain a ton of variation

Theory

- Colloquial definition: A hunch or a guess that is similar to a hypothesis

> A logically consistent set of statements that explains a phenomenon of interest (FLS, xxix)



---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Theories help us do a few things

1. Explain why something happens
2. Describe how things happen
3. Predict what will happen
4. Prescribe what we should do in a given situation




---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Theories require simplification

- The world is really complex

- Theories help us to focus on the most essential and influential factors

- Implication: All theories are, as a rule, "wrong" or "inaccurate"

- But...
  - Is it useful? 
  - Does it help us to explain or understand something about the world? 
  - Does it advance upon previous theories? 
  - Does it generate clear expectations or implications?




---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Theories and falsifiability

- We can never prove a theory "true"

- Much of what we deal with is probabilistic, not deterministic

- New events can always come along and create new data that will weaken or prove a theory wrong

# The Research Process

Organizing analysis

- It's hard

- Define the relevant actors

- How do we measure phenomena of interest?

- How do we structure our analysis?






---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Generating generalizable knowledge and inferences

- One observations is usually not sufficient

- We can't always identify causal relationships from casual inspection

- Often there are multiple causal factors

- Need variation in outcomes and predictors to assess general relationships




---
class: left, top

# The Research Process

Measurement

- We need some way to evaluate the relative frequency, intensity, gradations, etc., of phenomena of interest

- This means we have to **define** and **measure** the things we're interested in tracking across space and time

  - **Validity**: Is your measurement an appropriate proxy or operationalization of the underlying concept?

  - **Reliability**: Is your measurement scheme *consistently* capturing into the underlying concept?

- Even qualitative analysis require measurement schemes

# The Research Process

Case studies

Observational studies

- Can take lots of different forms

- Often involves collecting lots of measurements of different variables for lots of different units

- Predictor variables are not under the control of the researcher

- Attempt to design the study in such a way as to maximize validity, reduce, biases, etc.

# The Research Process

Experimental Studies

- Researcher control all (or almost all) of the treatment assignment

- The **treatment** is the predictor whose causal effect on the outcome is what we're trying to measure

- Researcher controls assignment so easier to reduce biases

# The Research Process

Experimental vs observational

- Experimental is "ideal" in lots of ways, but researchers often can't do this for a variety of reasons (e.g. ethical concerns, feasibility, etc.)

- Learning how to structure good observational studies is just as important as learning how to conduct a randomized controlled trial

# The Research Process

Conclusions and assessment

- Do the results match your expectations/support your hypothesis?

- Substantive significance?

- Statistical significance?

- Have you adjusted for potentially confounding factors?

- Are there multiple interpretations of the results?

- Is reformulating the theory necessary?

- What questions remain?

- What steps should future researchers take?
