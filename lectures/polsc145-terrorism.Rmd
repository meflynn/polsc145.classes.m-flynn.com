# Lecture Overview

1. Defining terrorism

2. Organization

3. Why terror?

4. Responding to terrorism



---
# Key Questions and Goals

1. Develop a better understanding of why groups choose terror tactics vs other tactics

2. Develop a better understanding of the factors that lead some groups to use terror tactics

3. Think about the different types of targets and audiences for terror attacks

4. Think about the causal mechanisms by which terror is expected to bring about policy change

# Notes

- Australian national
- Primary attacker in New Zealand shootings of March, 2019, where he killed 50 Muslims during prayer services
- Also filmed the attack on a go-pro camera, broadcasting the killings online. Highlights the role played by social media platforms in helping to spread white supremacist and other radical ideologies.
- Also highlights “lone wolf” terror problem. Individuals acting along are typically radicalized through social networks of some kind (whether digital or not). Tarrant wrote a long manifesto wherein he echoed the sentiments expressed by the broader online white supremacist culture, specifically speaking to the “replacement” of white people by non-white groups. Individuals who act in a “lone wolf” manner typically have ties to extremist groups, even if they’re not official “members”.

# Notes

- Opposed Apartheid-the segregation of blacks in South Africa.
- Initially dedicated to passive resistance to the Apartheid regime. Eventually convinced that violent resistance was in order after the Sharpeville massacre, but tried to avoid hurting people. Formed the “Spear of the Nation” in 1961 to act at the armed wing of the ANC. The group focused on sabotage and bombings of unoccupied spaces, but did not rule out a turn to violence if sabotage tactics failed to work. People did actually die as a result of the group’s attacks.
- Left South Africa in 1962 to receive military training in Morocco and Ethiopia. He also traveled around Africa and England to enlist support for a military struggle.
- Arrested and put on trial for planning acts of sabotage and plotting guerrilla warfare to overthrow the government. Convicted of sabotage on June 11, 1964. Sentenced to life in prison on Robben Island.
- Elected President of African National Congress in 1991. 
1993 he and President FW de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize.
- Inaugurated as South Africa’s first democratically elected president on May 10, 1994. 
- Often remembered for his attitudes towards reconciliation between races.

# Notes

- Leader of the ultra-nationalist/Buddhist 969 Movement in Myanmar.
- Group is anti-Muslim. Associated with several attacks on Muslim civilians. Wirathu denies being involved in, or ordering, these attacks. 
- Yes, he’s a buddhist. 
- Opposed to Muslim presence in Myanmar. Seek to outlaw marriage of Buddhists to non-Buddhists. They have burned Muslim’s stores, assaulted Muslims in the streets with rocks and sticks. They also promote discrimination through the boycott of Muslim businesses, and also call for Buddhists to not hire Muslim workers.
- Muslims are associated with the “merchant” class in Myanmar. Some evidence that violence is economically motivated.
- 969 has been criticized by other Buddhist monks. Many Buddhist monasteries provide shelter to displaced

# Defining Terrorism

How would you define terrorism?

What criteria would you include? (e.g. targets, violence, type of action, etc.)

List:

.can-edit[

# Defining Terrorism

Terrorism is a label that is often used loosely, but it has more specific technical and legal definnitions

> **Terrorism**: The premeditated threat or use of violence against noncombatant targets by individuals or subnational groups to obtain a political or social objective through intimidation of a larger audience (FLS).



---
# Defining Terrorism

Let's break that down...

--

1. Premeditated

--

2. Threat OR use of violence

--

3. Perpetrators: Individuals O subnational groups

--

4. Targets: Non-combatants (immediate) and a larger audience (extended)

--

5. Goals: Various political, economic, and/or social goals




---
# Defining Terrorism

But what does this leave out?

- States and militaries as perpetrators?

- States and militaries as targets?

- Property as targets?



---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Organization





---
# Organization

Key Point: Terrorism is a **tactic**, not an identity

--

"Terrorist" is a label used to identify those who use terror as a tactic

--

Who cares? Why does this matter?

--

Because...

- Not all groups that use terror look alike
- Groups often fight using mixed strategies—important to understand who uses terror, why, when, and how 
- Legalities associated with who/what constitutes a legitimate enemy combatant
- Differentiating more routine acts of violence from terrorism



---
# Organization

Traditional military/paramilitary 

- Tamil Tigers
- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria

--

Networked Actors

- al Qaeda and affiliates
  - al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) (later Islamic State)
  - al Nusra Front (al Qaeda affiliate in Syria)
  - al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
  - al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb

--

Hybrid Groups

- Hezbollah
- Provisional Irish Republican Army/Sinn Fein




---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Tactics


---
# Tactics

So why do groups use terror?

- Power asymmetries

- Political power, representation, access (or lack thereof)

- Issue salience

- Broader support (or lack thereof)




???

# Notes

- Coercion: Get people to make concessions
- Provocation: Get target to respond and overreact
- Spoiling: Ruin a potential negotiation between target and more moderate groups
- Outbidding: Groups try to demonstrate superiod capabilities and attract followers.

# Notes

- Israel's counterattack against Hamas has affected roughly all 2.5 million inhabitants of Gaza.
- Hundreds of thousands of people are facing malnutrition and babies are dying of starvation.
- UN is warning as of March 7, 2024 that famine is almost inevitable as Israel controls access to aid. 
- Biden Administration initiated air drops to get aid to vulnerable people. Air drops are risky because you have no clear way to secure a drop zone or to distribute food among the needy.

- Also consider the messaging environment when states overreact. Hamas attacks led to a few days of coverage and 1,300 casualties. Israel's counterattack has lasted months and has killed tens of thousands, and press reports are relentless and constant across months.

# Notes

From Reuters:

> JERUSALEM, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Only 15% of Israelis want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stay in office after the war on Hamas in Gaza ends, though many more still support his strategy of crushing the militants in the Palestinian enclave, according to a poll published on Tuesday.
Netanyahu promised to crush Hamas after its Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 240 abducted to Gaza. Israeli forces have laid much of Gaza to waste in their nearly three-month retalitory offensive.
