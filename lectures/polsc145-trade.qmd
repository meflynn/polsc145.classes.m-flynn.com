## Lecture Overview

1. What is trade?

2. Why trade?

3. Trade protection

4. Trade as a policy instrument

5. International institutions and trade



## Key Questions and Goals

1. What is the difference between absolute and comparative advantage?

2. What are factors of production and how do they determine what states trade?

3. Define protectionism and identify different types of protectionist policies

4. If trade is so beneficial, why do countries implement protectionist policies?



# What is Trade?



## What is Trade?

> **Trade**: The exchange of goods and services between individuals

Key points

- Trade occurs between individuals

- States don’t *usually* trade with one another, but we talk about them anyway



## What is Trade?

Lots of ways to think about trade:

- Total trade
- Exports
- Imports
- Sector or industry (technology sector, auto industry, etc.)
- Specific goods and items 
  - North American Industry Classification System Item #522390: Other Activities Related to Credit Intermediation. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in facilitating credit intermediation (except mortgage and loan brokerage; and financial transactions processing, reserve, and clearinghouse activities). 
  - Illustrative Examples: Check cashing services, Money order issuance services, Loan servicing, Travelers' check issuance services, Money transmission services, and Payday lending services.

## Why Trade?



## Why Trade?

Gains from trade

- Needs (Food, natural resources, etc.)

- Want (Silks, Foods, Playstations, etc.)

- Capacity to produce yourself (Try building your own Playstation).

- Specialization: You can export goods you’re good at making and import goods you’re bad at making



## Why Trade?

Trade not always viewed as a good thing

- Mercantilism

- Emphasis is on self-sufficiency 

- Trade can benefit / enrich adversaries

- Colonies

Notes

- Smith emphasized specialization, but that requires larger markets. Doesn't make as much sense if there's not sufficient demand to sustain an activity. Noted that specialization requires large markets. Uses examples of porters and carpenters. They need large towns to be able to develop a skill and focus on that one area. People in small villages with small markets cannot afford to specialize because they can’t sell enough to subside. 

- Colonialism and tariffs are detrimental to overall welfare since they result in an inefficient allocation of resources.
> “That this monopoly of the home-market frequently gives great encouragement to that particular species of industry which enjoys it, and frequently turns towards that employment a greater share of both he labour and sock of the society than would have gone to it, cannot be doubted. But whether it tends either to increase the general industry of the society, or to give it the most advantageous direction, is not, perhaps, altogether so evident” (Smith 1776 [2004], 297-298).
  
  - Colonial residents are usually forced to buy finished goods manufactured int he metropole/mother country, and are prohibited from, or charged exorbitant fees to, buy goods made in other countries. 
Smith saw colonies as starting up trouble with other countries, too, resulting in greater military burdens on taxpayers. 

- On tariffs (general) (Smith 1776 [2004], 314):
> “The undertaker of a great manufacture, who, by the home markets being suddenly laid open to the competition of foreigners, should be obliged to abandon his trade, would no doubt suffer very considerably…The equitable regard, therefore, to his interests requires that changes of this kind should never be introduced suddenly, but slowly, gradually, and after a very long warning. The legislature, were it possible that its deliberations could be always directed, not by the clamorous importunity of partial interests, but by an extensive view of the general good, ought upon this very account, perhaps, to be particularly careful neither to establish any new monopolies of this kind, nor to extend further those which are already established.”

- Two cases where governments should tax foreign trade (Smith 1776 [2004], 307-308):
  - First, cases where national security is somehow at issue. 
  - Second, if some tax is imposed on domestically produced goods, an equal tax levied on foreign goods of the same type would level the playing field. It doesn’t discriminate, only matches. 

- State has three primary purposes (Smith 1776 [2004], Book V):
  - Provide for national defense
  - Administration of justice and enforcing contracts: “The second duty of the sovereign, that of protecting, as far as possible, every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other member of it…”
  - Providing for various public goods: “The third and last duty of the sovereign is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works , which, though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are however, of such a nature, that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual or small number of individuals, and which it therefore cannot be expected that any individual or small number of individuals should erect or maintain.”

## Why Trade?

Comparative advantage

- People / countries should focus on relative strengths

- Does not mean you do it better than anyone else (i.e. Absolute advantage)

- Comparative advantage is about opportunity costs of production

Comparative Advantage

- The values in each cell represent the ours required to produce one unit of a given good. For example, 15 ours to produce one unit of clothing in England, 30 hours to produce one cask of wine in England, etc.

- Note at the beginning that it takes less time to produce both goods in Portugal (compare the values within each good's column). It only takes 10 and 15 hours to produce clothing and wine respectively.

Opportunity Costs

- We want to understand the opportunity costs associated with producing a given good. 

- Differently, what are we giving up to produce one unit of X?

- To get at this we simply divide the value of a good in question by the other good we're interestsed in.

- For example: $$ Clothing \over Wine $$ Gives us the opportunity costs of producing clothing—how many units of Wine could we produce in the time it took us to produce one unit of clothing.

Opportunity Costs

- Using these values we want to see which country's value is lower for each good.

Opportunity Costs

- The lower value tells us who should produce a given good.

## Why Trade?

Why do states produce what they do?

- States will produce what they can produce

- We must consider abundance and scarcity of factors of production

  - Land

  - Unskilled labor

  - Skilled labor (human capital)

  - Capital
  
  
  
  
## Why Trade?

Heckscher–Ohlin theory

- Countries will export goods that make intensive use of the factors that are abundant

- Countries will import goods that make intensive use of the factors that are scarce





# Trade Protection



## Trade Protection

If trade is so good why do we see people fighting against it?

What is trade protection?

> **Protectionism**: Policies aimed at protecting domestic industries, often by blocking competing imports from other countries or using subsidies to prop up domestic industries.

Examples include tariffs, quotas, subsidies





## Trade Protection

Motivation for protection

- Trade creates winners and losers

- Free trade can produce aggregate gains, but some groups will also be hurt

- National versus international markets and competition






## Trade Protection

Balance of Trade

$$\text{Balance of Trade}_{it} = \text{Exports}_{it} – \text{Imports}_{it}$$


- Positive values represent a trade surplus

- Negative values represent a trade deficit

## Trade Protection

:::{.incremental}
Does this actually mean the economy loses money? 

No, because there’s more to the economy than trade.

How we measure GDP:

$$GDP = Consumption + Investment + GovernmentSpending + (Exports - Imports)$$

But this is still a politically powerful idea used to mobilize broader support

Notes

- First, this just includes the costs of materials used.
- Second, the parts come from firms based all over the world:
  - Samsung is based in Korea
  - Apple is based in the United States
  - Qualcomm is based in the United States
  - Dialog Semiconductor is based in the United Kingdom
  - STMicroelectronics is based in Switzerland
  - Broadcom LTD is based in the United States
  - Skyworks Solutions is based in the United States
  - Cirrus Logic is based in the United States
  - NXP Semiconductors is based in the Netherlands
  - Bosch Sensortec is based in Germany
  - Alps Electric is based in Japan
  - AMS is based in Austria
  - Texas Instruments is based in Japan
  - Murata Manufacturing is based in Japan
  - Sunwoda electronics is based in China
  
  - Overall value added from China is about $18 but the total value is counted against the US-China balance of trade. See this [NPR story](https://www.npr.org/2011/01/18/133029198/Tracing-The-Trade-Deficit-Back-To-The-iPhone#:~:text=the%20whole%20story.-,The%20Apple%20iPhone%20is%20an%20iconic%20American%20product%2C%20invented%2C%20designed,of%20hundreds%20of%20individual%20parts.) and [this story](https://theconversation.com/the-guts-of-an-apple-iphone-show-exactly-what-trump-gets-wrong-about-trade-119223) from the Conversation.
  
- Third, labor costs typically fall in the $5-$10 range for iPhones like this. This is the value added from manufacturing in China.

##  Trade Protection

Economic explanations for protectionism

**Stolper–Samuelson Theorem**

- Owners of the scarce factors of production in a country will support protection

- Assumes factors of production are mobile

**Ricardo–Viner Model**

- Support and opposition to free trade are linked to sector-specific interests

- Assumes that factors of production are immobile

## Trade Protection 

Policymakers’ perspectives

- Policymakers don’t represent the entire country

- Legislators represent distinct geographic and/or economic constituencies

- Protection is a way to provide benefits to those constituents
